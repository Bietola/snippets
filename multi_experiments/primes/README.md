## Description
A program that quickly calculates primes using multiple cores. The technique used relies primarily on the *log approximation*: once it is cacluated in constant time(call it L), the range [0, L) is divided equally among the required amount of threads. The threads then independenly calculate the prime numbers in their assigned ranges. Once they're all done, their counts are summed (-> S), then a single-threaded portion of the program finishes off the algorithm by making some final adjustments (which are intuitive enough to be better left unspecified). The advantage of using the approximation is to limit the time spent in this last part (which in facts results infinitesimal in comparison with the multi-threaded portion of the program).
